<h3>Assumptions</h3>

As an agricultural minister whose country is facing food shortages, it is important to organise the priorities in dealing with the issue, which will influence the decision making process.

1. Increasing food supply for local consumption is the main priority and anything else such as economic trade to increase trade revenue or GDP would be secondary

2. Nutrtional value of the crop is essential to sustain the population. This prioritises calorie density as well other macronutrients. In the code, this is formulated as a nutritional index.
